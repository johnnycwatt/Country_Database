# Country_Database

This is a personal project with the purpose of serving as practice for Python Fundamentals
There is a csv file "countries.csv" which contains a list of every country in the world and their respective continent.
The program will ask for the users input, allowing the user to search either by country or continent.

For example, if the users input was "China" the output would be "Asia". 
Alternatively if the users input was "Asia" the output would be every country in Asia.

I plan to add more data to the countries.csv file in the future to include population, capital city and language.

This way the user will be able to search by country name, population, language, capital city or continent.
